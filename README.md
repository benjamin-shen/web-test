Final Project for Intro CS with Mr. Holmes (Spring 2016)  
Collaborator: Albert Ryu  
Github: [benjamin-shen/web-test](https://github.com/benjamin-shen/web-test)

Our original project is archived ([commit #1](https://github.com/benjamin-shen/web-test/tree/1b2b027d77804e18af35e52b751ecd2995d631b5)). This high school project was hosted on homer.stuy.edu and our accounts on homer are now cleaned out. Thus, the archived version has many links that break and is almost entirely obsolete.  

The most recent version is migrated to heroku. A lot of the code has been cleaned up to work properly in Python 3.
