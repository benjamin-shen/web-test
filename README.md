Final Project for Intro CS with Mr. Holmes (Spring 2016)  
Collaborator: Albert Ryu

This high school project was hosted on homer.stuy.edu (an Apache server) and thus some absolute links are broken. I'm archiving the project ([commit #1](https://github.com/benjamin-shen/web-test/tree/1b2b027d77804e18af35e52b751ecd2995d631b5) on Github) because our accounts on homer are cleaned out.  
See the documentation for project details. We got 100! Thanks Albert.  

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own projects. In hindsight Python probably wasn't the best language to use for what we wanted to accomplish.  

I attempted to migrate it to heroku but [it doesn't support CGI scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13520175/run-python-cgi-application-on-heroku). I welcome pull requests but for now this project will remain a wonderful dose of nostalgia.
