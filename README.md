Final Project for Intro CS with Mr. Holmes (Spring 2016)

This high school project was hosted on homer.stuy.edu (an Apache server) and thus some absolute links are broken.  
See the documentation for project details. We got 100!  

Feel free to use my code as a reference for your own projects. In hindsight Python probably wasn't the best language to use for what we wanted to accomplish.  
### Currently migrating to heroku.
