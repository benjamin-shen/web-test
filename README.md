Final Project for Intro CS with Mr. Holmes (Spring 2016)  
Collaborator: Albert Ryu  
Grade: 100  
Github: [benjamin-shen/web-test](https://github.com/benjamin-shen/web-test)

Our original project is archived on Github ([commit #1](https://github.com/benjamin-shen/web-test/tree/1b2b027d77804e18af35e52b751ecd2995d631b5)). This high school project was hosted on homer.stuy.edu and our accounts on homer are now cleaned out. Thus, the archived version has many links that break and is almost entirely obsolete.  

The most recent version is migrated to [heroku](https://introcs-finalproject.herokuapp.com/login). I cleaned up and altered a lot of the code so that it works properly.
