Final Project for Intro CS with Mr. Holmes (Spring 2016)
Collaborator: Albert Ryu

This high school project was hosted on homer.stuy.edu (an Apache server) and thus some absolute links are broken. I'm archiving the project on Github for now because our accounts on homer are cleaned out.  
See the documentation for project details. We got 100! Thanks Albert.  

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own projects. In hindsight Python probably wasn't the best language to use for what we wanted to accomplish.  

I attempted to migrate it to heroku but [it doesn't support CGI scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13520175/run-python-cgi-application-on-heroku). I welcome pull requests but for now this project will remain a wonderful dose of nostalgia.
